1. What is a CSS Framework?
A CSS framework is a pre-prepared library of CSS code that helps you design web pages quickly and efficiently. It provides ready-to-use components like buttons, forms, grid systems, and utility classes, reducing the need to write custom CSS from scratch.

Popular examples: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Bulma, Foundation.

2. Why CSS Framework over CSS?

Using a CSS framework over raw CSS offers several benefits:

✅ Faster development: Predefined classes and components save time.

✅ Responsive design: Built-in breakpoints and grid systems simplify responsiveness.

✅ Consistency: Ensures a uniform look and feel across the project.

✅ Cross-browser compatibility: Most frameworks handle this for you.

✅ Reduced boilerplate: Avoids repetitive code writing.

3. What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style your HTML elements using short, reusable utility classes (like bg-blue-500, text-center, mt-4, etc.) directly in the markup.

Instead of writing custom CSS for each element, you compose your design using these utility classes.

4. Advantages of Tailwind CSS:

⚡ Fast development: Utility classes eliminate context switching between HTML and CSS.

🎨 Highly customizable: You can configure themes, colors, breakpoints, and more.

📦 No unused CSS: PurgeCSS can remove unused styles in production, reducing bundle size.

🧩 Responsive design made easy: Built-in responsive utilities.

💻 Consistency: Promotes design consistency across the app.

5. Disadvantages of Tailwind CSS:

📄 Cluttered HTML: Markup can become long and hard to read due to many utility classes.

📘 Learning curve: Developers must learn a new set of class names.

🎨 Lack of components: Unlike Bootstrap, it doesn’t come with prebuilt UI components.

🔁 Repetition: Similar styles may be repeated across elements unless you extract reusable components.
